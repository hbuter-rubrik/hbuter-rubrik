I'm a Sales Engineer at Rubrik #briklayer who's trying to to automate things using PowerShell & Python. Each day you live you learn! The repos found here are mostly my scripts that I either use for demo's or scripts that I have used to help customers and the Rubrik community.

<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and reading "Automate the boring stuff with Python 2nd edition"<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m trying to colloborate on Rubrik Build Powershell & Python repo, where I can and add some scripts<br>
